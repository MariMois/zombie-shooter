🧟‍♂️ Zombie Shooter — Bridge Road Edition

Zombie Shooter is a fast-paced, retro-style survival game where chaos meets strategy. Set on a dark, endless bridge under siege, you control a lone soldier fighting relentless waves of the undead.

Your mission? Survive as long as possible.
Your tools? Guns, drones, and quick reflexes.

🎮 Gameplay Overview

Move and Shoot: Navigate the bridge, dodge incoming enemies, and unleash firepower to keep the zombies back.

Perk Crates: Randomly spawn across the battlefield — but never too close together. Open them to gain temporary buffs, from faster shots to bonus drones.

Drones: Deploy autonomous helpers that attack nearby zombies, but be quick — each drone has a limited lifespan.

Perk Stacking: Power-ups are capped to keep things balanced. Each perk expires after a set time, so strategy matters as much as aim.

Lives & Score: Once you run out of lives, the game ends — but your final score is saved for glory (and bragging rights).

⚙️ Features

Wave Progression: Enemies become stronger and spawn in greater numbers the longer you survive.

Simple Controls, Deep Play: Easy to pick up, but skill-based survival keeps it challenging.

Dynamic HUD: Streamlined interface — stats and health on the top left, controls on the top right, perks at the lower left, and debug info at the lower right.

Retro Aesthetics: Pixel-styled soldiers and zombies with clean visual polish, inspired by old-school/retro looking games like Flappy Bird and Dangerous Dave.

Optimized for Web: Lightweight, fast-loading, and fully playable in-browser — perfect for GitHub Pages.

💡 Extra Touches

Mute Button for peace and focus.

Constant Yellow Double Line down the road for visual stability and immersion.
